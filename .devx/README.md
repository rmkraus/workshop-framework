The [NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization (VSS)](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/video-search-and-summarization) helps you build video analytics AI agents that let industrial operators communicate with their infrastructure through search and summarization of live or archived video sensor data. It integrates vision language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and NVIDIA NIMâ„¢ to deliver a whole new level of collaboration.

This workshop will help get you to get started integrating this blueprint in your enterprise. At the end of this workshop, you will go home with:

 - access to NVIDIA cloud resources and documentation
 - a running copy of the VSS blueprint
 - turn-key, portable, developement environment
 - a custom integrated application

 The entire lab can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours to complete.
